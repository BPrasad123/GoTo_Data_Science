**Posisson distribution vs Binomial distribution**  
If your question has an average probability of an event happening per unit (i.e. per unit of time, cycle, event) and you want to find probability of a certain number of events happening in a period of time (or number of events), then use the Poisson Distribution.
If you are given an exact probability and you want to find the probability of the event happening a certain number of times out of x (e.g., 10 times out of 100, or 99 times out of 1000), use the Binomial Distribution formula.
