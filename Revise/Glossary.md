**ICA (Independent Component Analysis)**    
When multiple data are mixed, it tries to separate them. It holds two assumptions: 1. The variables should be mutually exclusive. 2. The distribution should not be gaussian for both the variables.

**P value**  
a p-value of 0.05 or greater means that the distribution is a normal distribution.
